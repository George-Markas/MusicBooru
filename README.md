# MusicBooru
MusicBooru is a web app for streaming music over the network. It allows the uploading
and playback of audio files in common formats (such as FLAC and MP3). Song metadata is
extracted from the uploaded files for display and organization on the frontend.

**This project is still very much work in progress.** It is made for the "Special Topics in Software Engineering"
course.
